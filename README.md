# Simple Clipboard History

ðŸ“‹ Clipboard history doesn't work on one of my machines, so ChatGPT and I made our own!

This repo has the script you need and the batch file to run it. If you have admin rights on your machine, you can set the script to run automatically. If not, follow [these instructions](https://superuser.com/a/193255) to pin the batch file to your task bar for easy access.

This is a very simple script with plenty of room for improvement. A couple of ideas:
- Add a hotkey to bring up the history window. In Windows, that is `Win+V`.
- Add the ability to store images like the Windows clipboard does.
- Add some sort of white background that keeps multiline clipboard elements from showing if they stretch below the other clipboard elements. (aesthetic improvement)

I would love it if you forked the repo and made a better version!
